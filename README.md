ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Alex, a passionate Software Engineer with expertise in .NET, AWS, and cloud technologies.

ðŸ’¡ I thrive on exploring the inner workings of technology, from graphics rendering and networking to AWS infrastructure and Kubernetes. Whether itâ€™s diving into the complexities of NAS systems or crafting efficient software, Iâ€™m endlessly curious about what makes things tick.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to become a Software Craftsman, dedicated to designing well-architected, efficient systems that solve real-world problems and deliver value.

ðŸŽ® Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me gaming, experimenting in the kitchen, or enjoying great music.

ðŸ“« Feel free to explore my repositories or connectâ€”Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate and share ideas!
